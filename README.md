Empowering Elderly Care with Multi-Agent AI System

This project leverages a Multi-Agent AI architecture to revolutionize elderly care by combining the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), LangGraph, Pydantic AI, and intelligent AI agents. Each agent specializes in distinct care functionsâ€”medication reminders, emotional support, health monitoring, and daily task assistanceâ€”working collaboratively in a modular, graph-based framework to provide personalized and proactive support for elderly individuals.

Key technologies:

ðŸ¤– LLMs: Powering conversational understanding and decision-making

ðŸ§  LangGraph: Orchestrating agent interactions through dynamic graph logic

ðŸ§© Pydantic AI: Structuring agent input/output with strong type safety and validation

ðŸ‘¥ Multi-Agent Coordination: Specialized AI roles for holistic elderly care
